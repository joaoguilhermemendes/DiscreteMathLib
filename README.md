# Discrete Math Functions Collection
This repository contains a collection of Python functions designed to perform various operations commonly encountered in discrete mathematics courses. Whether you're studying sets, relations, functions, combinatorics, or graph theory, this collection aims to provide helpful tools to assist you in your studies.

## Functions Included:
 - Union: Computes the union of two sets.
 - Intersection: Computes the intersection of two sets.
 - Symmetric Difference: Calculates the symmetric difference between two sets.
 - More...

## Samples Demonstration
#### INPUT
```python
[ SUMMATION ]

Expression: (4*x ** 2)/2*x <br>
Initial index: 0 <br>
Final index: 5 <br>
```

#### OUTPUT
```python
[ SUMMATION ]

Σ (i=0 to 2) = (4*x ** 2)/2*x

Σ = [0.0, 2.0, 16.0]
Σ = 18.0
```

## To Do:
 - [x] Code the (Basic) TRUE TABLE function
 - [ ] Create a generalized function for the user creates a logic expression (e.g. https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/)
 - [x] Re-Order index (Remove 01 | Maybe 07, 08 (need to think about))
 - [x] Create a Label for the prints (e.g. [ UNION ]) / some different color
 - [x] Step-by-Step Demonstrations
 - [ ] Quick description in call functions
 - [x] Improve Summation equation possibilities
